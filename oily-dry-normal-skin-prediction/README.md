# Skin Type Prediction App ‍⚕️

This project utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet50 model to predict skin type (oily, normal, dry) based on a user-uploaded image.

## Features:

    Simple and user-friendly interface: Upload an image and get your skin type prediction instantly!
    Clear instructions: The sidebar provides guidance on image selection for optimal results.
    Model transparency: Information about the underlying fine-tuned ResNet50 model and its training data is readily available.
    Streamlit framework: Built with Streamlit for a lightweight and efficient web application.

## Prerequisites:

        Python
        Streamlit
        PyTorch
        Pandas
        Matplotlib
        Seaborn
        torchvision (for image transformations)

## Replace placeholders:

    Update model_path in app.py with the path to your saved fine-tuned model.

## Run the app:

streamlit run app.py
